# Overview
This project utilizes Kaggleâ€™s Red Wine Quality dataset to construct multiple classification models aimed at predicting whether a given red wine qualifies as "good quality." Each wine in the dataset is assigned a quality score between 0 and 10, which is transformed into a binary output: "good quality" for scores of 7 or higher and "not good quality" for scores below 7. The quality assessment relies on 11 input variables encompassing various chemical properties.
